Intro to Spec objects
---------------------

All parameters in a **leabra7** simulation are contained in "spec
objects." A layer's parameters are contained in a
:py:class:`LayerSpec` object, a projection's parameters are contained
in a :py:class:`ProjnSpec` object, and so on. This allows you to
easily create many objects with the same bundle of parameters. For
example, to create three layers with the :code:`inhibition_type`
parameter set to *k-winner-take-all inhibition*, you could use the
following code:

.. code-block:: python

		import leabra7 as lb

		net = lb.Net()

		layer_spec = lb.LayerSpec(inhibition_type="kwta")
		net.new_layer(name="layer1", spec=layer_spec)
		net.new_layer(name="layer2", spec=layer_spec)
		net.new_layer(name="layer3", spec=layer_spec)

If you don't provide a value for a parameter in the spec's
constructor, it will be set to its default value. Here, we create a
layer spec object with all parameters set to their default values:

.. code-block:: python

		>>> default_layer_spec = lb.LayerSpec()

Since parameters are stored as class attributes, we can access them
using dot notation:

.. code-block:: python

		>>> default_layer_spec.inhibition_type
		"fffb"

We see that by default, the layer spec's :code:`inhibition_type`
parameter is set to :code:`"fffb"`, which stands for
*feedforward/feedback inhibition*. To override the value, we would
simply provide the desired value for :code:`inhibition_type` as a
keyword argument in the constructor:

.. code-block:: python

		>>> lb.LayerSpec(inhibition_type="kwta").inhibition_type
		"kwta"

If you try to set a parameter that doesn't exist, an exception will be raised

.. code-block:: python

		>>> lb.LayerSpec(nonexistent_param=3)
		ValueError: nonexistent_param is not a valid parameter name for this spec.

Below is a list of all the specs in leabra7, along with their
parameters and default values:

LayerSpec
---------

.. py:class:: LayerSpec()

   Contains parameters for network layers.

   .. py:attribute:: inhibition_type

      The type of inhibition. Can be :code:`"fffb"` for standard
      feedforward/feedback inhibition, :code:`"kwta"` for
      k-winner-take-all inhibition, or :code:`"kwta_avg"` for
      average-based k-winner-take-all inhibition. Defaults to
      :code:`"fffb"`.

      KWTA inhibition sets the inhibition so that only *k* units have
      a :code:`"v_m_eq"` value above their firing threshold.

      KWTA-average inhibition is slightly more complicated:
      for each unit in a layer of size :math:`n`, it calculates the
      inhibition :math:`gi_{thr}` that will put it at its firing
      threshold. Then it calculates two averages:

      1. The average of the top :math:`k` values of :math:`gi_{thr}`,
         called :code:`gi_k`.
      2. The average of the bottom :math:`n - k` values of
         :math:`gi_{thr}`, called :code:`gi_nk`

      The final inhibition is a convex combination of these two
      values: :code:`p * gi_k + (1 - p) * gi_nk`. The value of
      :code:`p` is determined by :attr:`kwta_pt`.

   .. py:attribute:: kwta_pct

      The proportion of winners for KWTA inhibition. Defaults to
      :code:`0.1`.

   .. py:attribute:: kwta_pt

      In KWTA-average inhibition, the convex combination parameter
      :code:`p`. See :attr:`inhibition_type`. Defaults to
      :code:`0.5`. Valid values are any float in the range :math:`[0,
      1]`.

   .. py:attribute:: ff

      The feedforward inhibition multiplier for feedforward/feedback
      inhibition. Controls the relative strength of feedforward
      inhibition. Defaults to :code:`1.0`. Valid values are any float
      in the range :math:`[0, \infty)`.

   .. py:attribute:: ff0

      The feedforward inhibition offset. A layer with average
      activation below this level will not trigger feedforward
      inhibition. Defaults to :code:`0.1`. Valid values are any float
      in the range :math:`[0, \infty]`.

   .. py:attribute:: fb

      The feedback inhibition multiplier for feedforward/feedback
      inhibition. Controls the relative strength of feedback
      inhibition. Defaults to :code:`1.0`. Valid values are any float
      in the range :math:`[0, \infty)`.

   .. py:attribute:: fb_dt

   .. py:attribute:: gi

      The global inhibition multiplier. Controls the relative strength
      of total (feedforward and feedback) inhibition. Defaults to
      :code:`1.8`. Valid values are any float in the range :math:`[0,
      \infty]`.

   .. py:attribute:: avg_dt

      The integration constant for the :code:`cos_diff_avg` error
      metric (between plus and minus phase activations), which can be
      used to modulate the proportion of Hebbian learning and the
      learning rate. Defaults to :code:`0.01`. Valid values are any
      float in the range :math:`[0, \infty]`.

   .. py:attribute:: clamp_max

      Typically, units in input and output layers are clamped to
      binary values (0 or 1). But units cannot support an activation
      of 1. Thus any value above :code:`clamp_max` will be reduced to
      :code:`clamp_max` prior to clamping. Defaults to
      :code:`0.95`. Valid values are any float in the range :math:`[0,
      1)`.

   .. py:attribute:: unit_spec

      The :class:`UnitSpec` object containing parameters for the units
      in the layer. Defaults to a :class:`UnitSpec` object with all
      default parameter values.

   .. py:attribute:: log_on_cycle
   .. py:attribute:: log_on_trial
   .. py:attribute:: log_on_epoch
   .. py:attribute:: log_on_batch

      - :code:`avg_act`, the average layer activation.
      - :code:`avg_net`, the average layer net input.
      - :code:`cos_diff_avg`, the cosine difference between the trial
        plus-phase activation and the minus-phase activation.

      - :code:`unit_act`, the activation of each unit.
      - :code:`unit_adapt`, the adaption current of each unit.
      - :code:`unit_gc_i`, the inhibition current in each unit.
      - :code:`unit_i_net`, the net current in each unit.
      - :code:`unit_net_raw`, the unintegrated (raw) net input to each unit.
      - :code:`unit_net`, the integrated net input to each unit.
      - :code:`unit_spike`, the spike status of each unit.
      - :code:`unit_v_m_eq`, the equilibrium membrane potential of
        each unit (like :code:`v_m` but does not reset when a spike
        happens).
      - :code:`unit_v_m`, the membrane potential of each unit.

      :code:`(True, )`, which includes all pre layer units.

   .. py:attribute:: post_mask

      An iterable of booleans that selects which post layer units will
      be included in the projection. If the length is less than the
      number of units in the post layer, it will be tiled. If the
      length is greater, it will be truncated. Defaults to
      :code:`(True, )`, which includes all post layer units.

   .. py:attribute:: sparsity

      Sets the sparsity of the connection. If this is less than
      :code:`1.0`, then :code:`1.0 - sparsity` percent of the
      connections will be randomly disabled. Defaults to
      :code:`1.0`. Valid values are any float in the range :math:`[0,
      1]`.

   .. py:attribute:: projn_type

      Sets the type, or "pattern", of the projection. Defaults to

      \infty)`.

   .. py:attribute:: thr_l_mix

      Mixing constant determining the proportion of Hebbian
      learning. A value of :code:`0` denotes no Hebbian learning (so
      the learning will be completely error-driven), and a value of
      :code:`1` denotes only Hebbian learning. Defaults to
      :code:`0.1`. Valid values are any float in the range :math:`[0,
